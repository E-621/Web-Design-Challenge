# Web-Design-Challenge

For this homework, we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past assignment.  Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data concerning latitude.  In building this dashboard, we developed individual pages for each plot and a means by which we could navigate between them.  These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can compare all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.  Enjoy.
